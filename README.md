#SearchWP EPUB
Super simple plugin that enables indexing of EPUB publications with the **SearchWP plugin** ([https://searchwp.com/]()).

It is based on **Apache Tika** ([https://tika.apache.org/]()), so it is necessary that the hosting is enabled to run Java code.

To install (and eventually keep updated) the plugin I suggest to use the very handy **Github Updater**: [https://github.com/afragen/github-updater]()

Last but not least: in order to upload EPUB files as Media in WordPress, you first need to enable *mime-type*: [https://gist.github.com/gregoriopellegrino/895add2f01746733c5da2a5969079470]().
